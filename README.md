# Snapchat-Username
A basic python program that allows you to check if a username is available or not.
It comes with a basic GUI, nothing interesting. I'll do something more with this later on.

# Depedencies
+ Requests
+ PySimpleGUI

# Usage
If you want to run this, just type this on your terminal:
```
python usernames.py
```

Special thanks to sdushantha for the Snapchat header.
